# SE461 - Managing Software Systems - C#
**Professor: Dr. Ryan Rybarczyk** </br>
**Aug - Dec 2018**

This repository contains files from my SE461 course taken in the Fall of 2018 at Butler University. It contains the course notes and semester projects.

## Course Description	
Techniques, principles, and processes for developing large, complex software systems: systems analysis and specification, modeling, design patterns, implementation, validation and verification, quality assurance, and project management. A team-based software project is required. Prerequisite: SE361. (U-G)(3)

## Professor Syllabus Notes
This course is designed to teach students best practices in designing and implementing object-oriented systems of high quality. To accomplish this task, we start with an overview of software design patterns and their role in developing high-quality software. We then begin surveying different design-level software design patterns, such as the Bridge, Strategy, Wrapper Facade, and Visitor software design patterns. Next, we touch on software design patterns for building distributed systems. Finally, we finish the course by surveying software anti-patterns. These are common design mistakes that negatively impact system quality, such as degrading performance as the system scales in size and complexity. Students will have the opportunity to apply learned techniques on several programming projects throughout the semester.

## Course Objectives
The primary goal of this course is to expose students to best practices and techniques for designing and implementing object-oriented systems with high quality. Students should leave this course with a better understanding of how to appropriately manage software development. By the end of the course, students will have developed an understanding of the following main topics:
1. The purpose of software design patterns
1. The design goal and intent of different design patterns
1. Knowing what software design pattern to apply to a particular problem
1. Techniques for debugging object-oriented software systems
1. Techniques for identifying design flaws that negative impact system quality

## Course Projects
1. Arrays (Abstract Data Types)
1. Stacks and Queues (Basic Exception Safety)
1. Calculator (Command Pattern, (Abstract) Factory Pattern)
1. Calculator (Composite Pattern, Builder Pattern, Visitor Pattern)
1. Calculator (Iterator and Proxy Pattern)
